These are the hardware design files for a template Intel Edison Block. The Block form factor will work with the SparkFun Edison Blocks.

This template shows how you might implement your own Edison Block hardware, and includes a USB-serial converter in the schematic. The block itself is incomplete (layout still required). Add whatever functionality you want to the board.

These hardware files were created with KiCAD. You may need the KiCAD libraries available here: https://github.com/mogar/KiCAD_libs When opening these projects in KiCAD, you may need to change the path to the libraries from the above link. This can be done in preferences->libraries in both the schematic editor and the layout editor. Make sure the libraries noted there point to wherever you put the above KiCAD_libs repo.
